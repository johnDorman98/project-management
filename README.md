# Welcome to my Java Project Management Program. üëã

 This program is a project management system created for an example small structural engineering firm which will allow them to use the program use to keep track of the many projects on which they work.
  
 The project will also be my first Object-Oriented Program (OOP) demonstrating knowledge of OOP and will update this project as time goes on.
  
## Features
 
 * Allows the user to capture the details that will be used to create a new project object.
 * The user is able to update or change the details of the project.
 * The user is able to view uncompleted or overdue tasks.
 * The user is able to update the completion status for a project by using the project number.
 * The program reads projects for a text file and stores it allowing the user to add to the list of projects.
 * The user is able to add projects with updated details to the text file.

## Installation

 * In order to run this program you will need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) and a IDE in this case we will be using IntelliJ.
 * Below I will include instructions for installing JDK and IntellJ to get it setup and allow you to run the program.
   * Firstly for IntelliJ to work we will need to install JDK below will be instructions for that.
     * Click [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) to go to the JDK download page then download the installer for your operating system (OS).
     * Once it has been downloaded run the installer and follow the installers instructions, After the installation is finshed you can click close.
     * You can find a full guide on how to install JDK [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/install/overview-jdk-installation.html#GUID-8677A77F-231A-40F7-98B9-1FD0B48C346A__INSTALLINGTHEJDKANDJREONMICROSOFTWI-E04E8B17)
     * Next lets confirm that JDK has been installed correctly to do so type the following into the command-line/terminal.
     * *java --version* and you should see something similar to whats below
     
       ```
       java 17.0.2 2022-01-18 LTS
       Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 17.0.2+8-LTS-86)
       Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.2+8-LTS-86, mixed mode, sharing)
       ```
     * Do the same for *javac --version*
     
       ```
       javac 17.0.2
       ```
       
  * Now that JDK has been installed correctly we can now install IntelliJ clicking [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?fromIDE=#section=windows) for the downlaod page then downlod the community version for your OS.

    * Once it has been downloaded run the installer to download IntelliJ.
  
  * IntelliJ and JDK should both now be installed on your computer and you can now download or clone the program from github saving it somewhere you can find later.
